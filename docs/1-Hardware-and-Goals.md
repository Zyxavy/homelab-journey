# A Fresh Beginning

### Specs

- CPU:          I3-3240
- RAM:          1x 4GB DDR3 1600mhz
- Storage:      1x 1TB Seagate HDD
- Motherboard:  Asrock H61m-VS
- PSU:          Cougar VTE 600W 80+ Bronze


### Peripherals

I’m still saving up for a ~50 m Ethernet cable, and the room where the PC sits is already cluttered. For now, I’m using a spare Mercusys S12 mesh router that supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. It’s not an ideal setup, but it works.
